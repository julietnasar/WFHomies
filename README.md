# WFHomies
A web platform for the work from home community to find work from home spots

# Motivation
I myself am a WFHomie. After the pandemic, I began my career remote and forsee that it will continue to be that way. Although I am remote so have no office, I have found that stimulating and motivating 'office like' environment in various coffee shops and hotel lobbys. But, every time I find a new spot I have to dig through information to see if they are 'WFH Friendly'. Like how good is their Wifi? Do they allow laptops? 

This is when I had the inspiration for this platform. A space for WFHomies to join together and give WFH reviews of these spots. It is still very much a work in progress so if you share in my motivation please reach out to help!
